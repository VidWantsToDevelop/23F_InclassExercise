# 23F_InclassExercise

## Practice in details
For the in-class exercise we decided to prepare a small app that we will be developing side by side with the students during the lecture. The main goal of this exercise is to show how rich and versatile is the React's ecosystem and that almost any possible solution that insipired developer may be looking for has probably already been built and is somewhere out there.

During the practice we will create a simple authentication form using the below-mentioned libraries to quickly build a form, apply some styling to it using bootstrap, and simplify the process of data collection and processing.

As a cherry on top, we will integrate react library that allows for the simplest possible implementation of the toast notifications into the app. Toast messages will be indicating whether user has properly specified all the parameters in the form or anything else that developer would like to share with a end-user.

## Libraries used
"react-toastify" - used for creating pretty toast notifications.
"react-bootstrap" - used for applying stylings using React components.
"react-hook-form" - an efficient way of getting values of inputs from the form.
"create-react-app" - an easy way to create a fully functioning React app just by typing "npx create-react-app {project-name}" command.

Thank you!
